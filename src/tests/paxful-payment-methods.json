It's a small price to pay for maintaining desired level of privacy. USPS is normally more preferable as their packages are less susceptible to being tampered with.\r\n\r\nPackaging: It is always a good idea to be mindful of the package appearance use bills of higher value so that package won't be identified as containing any \"cash\".  DUSPS provides a range of free supplies for their prepaid services.\r\n\r\nTracking number: Use tracking number as your confirmation of payment.\r\n\r\nEstablishing trust:  Look for vendors with good ratings. Do a test run with a vendor for a lower amount.  By making a test run you would minimize exposure to the risk of loss when dealing with the unfamiliar vendor.\r\n\r\nCost:  Cash in the mail may appear a bit pricier than using Western Union or Money Gram. Think in terms of what price tag you would put to your privacy.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Do not use BTC obtained on Paxful to conduct any illegal activity.

After 10 days, you are on your own. I will need 24 hours to investigate to help avoid fraud from shady gift card buyers. I hope you understand.\r\n\r\n3) Once you open trade, you have 1 hour to verify each balance on each gift card. You will be provided with the web link to verify the balance. Once you verify the balance, I will list the trade as “Paid”, and you are expected to release funds immediately after. \r\n\r\n4) Your gift cards will be mailed to you the next business (non-holiday or weather emergency) morning via USPS. If you are paying for 10 gift cards at $25 on each card, I will mail them First Class mail with tracking. You will receive the tracking number in the same chat window we used to complete the order. You can pull up your completed trade by moving your mouse over your “user name and image” in the top right corner and then scroll down and click on “COMPLETED TRADES”. If you spend for more than 10 gift cards than I will mail your gift cards Priority Mail via USPS.
